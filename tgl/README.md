# TGL

A small C API exposing OpenGL utility functions, primarily loading GL
functions (upto 4.5) without involving `windows.h` whilst hiding prototypes
for GL versions other than that which is desired.

## Getting Started

### Obtaining

The project can be obtained from the git repository located at https://bitbucket.org/tpdavison/tgl.git, for example:

```
git clone https://bitbucket.org/tpdavison/tgl.git
```

However, the project is usually embedded in other projects as a git submodule.

### What's Included

```
tgl/
|-- doc/
|-- include/
|-- src/
```

The root directory contains the necessary configuration files.

The `doc` directory contains any documentation or configuration files for
redistribution to client programmers.

The `include` directory contains the public header files for redistribution to
client programmers.

The `src` directory contains the source code (including any private headers)
for the project.

### Using

The project is designed to be used as a dependent project within a parent
Visual Studio solution, producing a lib file to be linked against.

The project will build its lib files into a directory structure under a `build`
sub-directory in the solution directory.

For easy embedding within a parent solution, ensure the other projects in the
solution are using the `tdk.props`, `tdk.targets` and `tgl.lib.props`
configuration files by copying them into the various project directories and
including the following at the appropriate location in their `vcxproj` files:

```
<Import Project="tdk.props" />
<Import Project="tdk.targets" />
```

TGL is designed to let you select which version of OpenGL you would like to
expose in the client code.  To do so, ensure an appropriate `#define` is made
before including `tgl.h` in client source code, for example:

```
#define TGL_TARGET_GL_4_1
#include <tgl/tgl.h>
```
